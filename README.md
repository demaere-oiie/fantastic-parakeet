## Fantastic Parakeet

Fantastic Parakeet is a lo-dep (`dataclasses`,`sys`) package performing boolean operations on Bézier paths.

It builds from 2D-points up through Bézier paths, `xor` and `and` operations on them, to general boolean operations on those paths, and layers Euclidean as well as non-Euclidean transformations on top.

These [presentations](https://davelongpresentations.rcdis.co/) covering the implementation:
- Tricky Boundary Decisions w/ Bézier booleans (5 min)
- Totally Béziers: Deepdive (12 min + 6 min questions)

were given at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) during the Fall 1 2025 batch.
